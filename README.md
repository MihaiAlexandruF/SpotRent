# SpotRent 🏠

**SpotRent** is an open project that aims to simplify the process of finding rental apartments **directly from property owners**, avoiding unnecessary intermediary fees and agency noise.

## 🔍 Project Idea

In many real estate platforms, it's often hard to tell whether a listing is posted by a private owner or a real estate agency.  
**SpotRent** plans to solve that by:
- scraping rental data from public sources (legally)
- using AI to **automatically classify listings** (owner vs agency)
- creating a dedicated platform for landlords to post their properties directly  
- making the renting experience more transparent for everyone

## 🚧 Current Status

This project is at a **very early MVP stage**.  
Right now, the focus is on:
- collecting rental data (initially via Selenium-based scraping)
- building a dataset for model training
- preparing a clean and minimal frontend (React)

## 📌 Stack (planned)
- Python (Selenium + BeautifulSoup) for scraping
- Pandas + custom labeling for data prep
- HuggingFace / DeepSeek / Scikit-learn for AI classification
- React for frontend
- ASP.NET Core Web API

## 👋 Work in Progress

This repo is a work in progress. Contributions, feedback, or ideas are always welcome!
